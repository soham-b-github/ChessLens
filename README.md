## About
ChessLens is an intelligent, real-time chess game digitization system powered by computer vision and deep learning. Designed to bridge the gap between physical and digital chessboards, 
ChessLens monitors a live chess game through a camera, processes each move, and dynamically updates a virtual board on screen.

Unlike traditional Digital Game Technology (DGT) boards, ChessLens requires no embedded hardware or special pieces — just a standard chessboard, a webcam, and a laptop. It uses homography 
estimation to correct perspective distortion, a deep learning model to identify occupied squares, and real-time frame analysis to detect and visualize piece movements.

Built with scalability and accessibility in mind, ChessLens is ideal for broadcasting live chess games in tournaments, coaching setups, or casual club matches — all without expensive 
infrastructure.

Achieved an accuracy of 93.75%.
